| Common name  | Definition | Source |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Fertiliser | Fertiliser means a substance manufactured, intended for further manufacture, represented, supplied, or used as a means of directly or indirectly: <br> a) supplying nutrients to the soil; or <br> b) conditioning the soil by altering the biological, chemical, or physical composition of the soil | [View](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/1852-Bulk-Inorganic-Fertiliser-including-Guano-Fertiliser-from-all-countries-Import-Health-Standard){:target="_blank"} |
| Organic fertiliser | An organic fertilizer is a fertilizer that is derived from organic sources, including organic compost, cattle manures, poultry droppings, and domestic sewage. | [View](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/organic-fertilizer){:target="_blank"} |
| Manure | Manure is an organic matter derived from the solid animal wastes, used to improve the soil quality and increase the yield of healthy crops. | [View](https://byjus.com/biology/manure/){:target="_blank"} |
| Inorganic fertiliser | Inorganic fertiliser means a chemical product, of either inorganic mineral or synthetic origin, that provides nutrients to stimulate plant growth. | [View](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/1852-Bulk-Inorganic-Fertiliser-including-Guano-Fertiliser-from-all-countries-Import-Health-Standard){:target="_blank"} |
| Apply fertiliser | A fertiliser input additional to maintenance requirements which aims to raise soil nutrient status as measured by soil testing. | [View](https://www.fertiliser.org.nz/Site/code-of-practice/general/definitions.aspx){:target="_blank"} |
| Timing of fertiliser | Fertiliser application should be timed to achieve maximum plant uptake, thereby reducing losses of nutrients to the environment. | [View](https://www.fertiliser.org.nz/Site/code-of-practice/best-management-practices-considerations/fertiliser-use/timing_of_application.aspx){:target="_blank"} |
| Fertiliser storage | 1. Secure storage place to protect the product from the weather and reduce the risk of theft. <br> 2. Enclosed building capable of protecting the product from the weather and especially direct sunlight.| [View](https://www.yara.ie/crop-nutrition/fertiliser-handling-and-safety2/fertiliser-storage/){:target="_blank"} [View](https://www.yara.ie/crop-nutrition/fertiliser-handling-and-safety2/fertiliser-storage/){:target="_blank"} |
| Fertiliser user | A person who takes delivery of fertiliser materials for the purposes of applying them to the land. | [View](https://www.fertiliser.org.nz/Site/code-of-practice/general/definitions.aspx){:target="_blank"} |
| Nutrient losses | A small portion of nutrients is lost annually through the hydrological cycle and biological export to the atmosphere (Barnes et al. 1998). Major pathways in which these nutrients are lost include: soil erosion, leaching and gaseous losses. | [View](https://webpages.uidaho.edu/learn/ecology/lessons/lesson07/7_5.htm){:target="_blank"} |
| Synthetic Nitrogen Fertiliser | Synthetic (Not naturally produced)nitrogen fertiliser means any substance (whether solid or liquid) that is more than 5% nitrogen by weight and is applied to any plant or soil as a source of nitrogen nutrition for plants. | [View](https://www.google.com/){:target="_blank"} |
| Product Category | Product Category is used in the Product Details component. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Land%20Application%20Standard/LADS_Lists-of-Valid-Values.md#Product-Category){:target="_blank"} |
| Product Code | An identifier for the product (within the application scope), for example, an inventory stock keeping unit | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Land%20Application%20Standard/LADS_Land-Applications-Data-Dictionary.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Product Name | A display or common name of the product. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Land%20Application%20Standard/LADS_Land-Applications-Data-Dictionary.md){:target="_blank"} |
