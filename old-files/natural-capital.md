| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Land Units | An area of contiguous or non-contiguous land with similar natural and/ or biophysical characteristics”. These units are based on the natural and modified biophysical characteristics of the land (i.e., modified through surface or sub-surface drainage and/or the addition of irrigation water) and should be described on a spatial basis. | - |
| Slope | 1. a surface of which one end or side is at a higher level than another; a rising or falling surface. <br> 2. slope is the percent change in elevation over a certain distance| [View](https://www.google.com/){:target="_blank"} |
| Landscape | A specific geomorphic feature on the surface of the earth, ranging from large-scale features such as plains, plateaus, and mountains to minor features such as hills, valleys, and alluvial fans. | - |
| Soil loss | Soil loss also means a loss of plant nutrients and organic matter, which can impair the land’s productivity. | [View](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/soil-loss){:target="_blank"} |
| Soil destruction | In agriculture, soil erosion refers to the wearing away of a field's topsoil by the natural physical forces of water and wind or through forces associated with farming activities such as tillage. | [View](https://www.ontario.ca/page/soil-erosion-causes-and-effects){:target="_blank"} |
| Wetland | Wetlands are areas where water is the primary factor controlling the environment and associated plant and animal life. | [View](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/){:target="_blank"} |
| Type of soil | A soil type is a taxonomic unit in soil science. All soils that share a certain set of well-defined properties form a distinctive soil type | [View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_type){:target="_blank"} |
| Lakes | a large area of water surrounded by land | [View](https://www.google.com/){:target="_blank"} |
| Biodiversity area | Biodiversity is short for biological diversity and describes the variety and diversity of the ecosystem | [View](https://www.google.com/){:target="_blank"} |
| Fish Spawning areas | Area where fish Spawn | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Feature-Catalogue.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Land Cover Unit | The geometry of a Land Cover observation. More commonly used for regional and national planning purposes. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Irrigation%20and%20Effluent/IEDS_Irrigation-and-Effluent-Data-Dictionary.md#Climatic-and-Weather-Observations){:target="_blank"} |
| Watercourse | A natural or man-made flowing watercourse or stream. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Feature-Catalogue.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Dam | A permanent barrier across a watercourse used to impound water or to control its flow. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Feature-Catalogue.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Available water | Amount of water plants can extract from the soil, the difference in moisture content between field capacity and permanent wilting point. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Feature-Catalogue.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Soil Body | Part of the soil cover that is delineated and that is homogeneous with regard to certain soil properties and/or spatial patterns. NB: This is synonymous with soil zones as defined in Farm and Model Data Standard. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Feature-Catalogue.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Soil characteristics | Physical properties of soil include color, texture, structure, porosity, density, consistence, aggregate stability, and temperature. | [View](https://www.google.com/){:target="_blank"} |
| Geographic Coordinates | Representing a location, using latitude and longitude, or a recognised coordinate system identified using the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) parameter registry guide. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Feature-Catalogue.md){:target="_blank"} |
| Land Management Units | An area of land that can be farmed or managed in a similar way, due to the soil type, capabilities and function, farm infrastructure, and strategic importance to the farming system. | [View](https://www.fertiliser.org.nz/Site/code-of-practice/general/definitions.aspx){:target="_blank"} |
| Aerodrome Area | A defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations and equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure and surface movement of aircraft and/or helicopters. | [View](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Farm%20Features%20and%20Attributes/FFADS_Location-Identification_&_Spatial-Attributes.md#Location-Identification){:target="_blank"} |
