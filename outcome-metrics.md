| Term 	| Synonyms 	| Definition  	| Data Type 	| Regulatory Context 	| Source 	| Data Specifications 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Ammonia Volatalisation 	| Volatalization 	| The loss of N through the conversion of ammonium to ammonia gas, which is released to the atmosphere. The volatilization losses increase at higher soil pH and conditions that favor evaporation (e.g. hot and windy). 	|  	| Emissions 	| [View](http://cceonondaga.org/resources/nitrogen-basics-the-nitrogen-cycle){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Carbon dioxide equivalent 	| CO2e 	| The quantity of a given greenhouse gas multiplied by its global warming potential, which equates its global warming impact relative to carbon dioxide (CO2). This is the standard unit for comparing the degree of warming which can be caused by emissions of different greenhouse gases. 	| Integer 	| Emissions 	| [View](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/discussion-paper-on-measures-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-new-zealand-post-2012/12-glossary/){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Dissolved Nutrients 	|  	| Soluable forms of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorous. 	|  	| Fresh water 	| [View](https://www.boprc.govt.nz/media/31172/Plan-090528-OSETPlanDefinitionOfTerms.pdf){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Emissions Factor 	| Greenhouse gas emission coefficient, intensity factor 	| An intensity factor relating greenhouse gas emissions per unit of activity (such as tonnes of fuel consumed, tonnes of product produced). 	| Float 	| Biodiversity 	| [View](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/discussion-paper-on-measures-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-new-zealand-post-2012/12-glossary/){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| GHG Emissions Inventory 	| GHG Inventory, Emissions Inventory 	| A list of an organisation’s or a country’s greenhouse gas emissions by sources, removals by sinks, and stocks. 	| String 	| Emissions 	| [View](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/discussion-paper-on-measures-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-new-zealand-post-2012/12-glossary/){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Greenhouse gas emission 	| Emissions, GHG Emission, GHG 	| Greenhouse gases are constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. Greenhouse gas emissions covered by the emissions limitation or reduction commitment for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). 	| String 	| Emissions 	| [View](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/discussion-paper-on-measures-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-new-zealand-post-2012/12-glossary/){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Nutrient Budget 	| Nutrient Balance 	| The difference between the nutrient inputs entering a farming system (mainly livestock manure and fertilisers) and the nutrient outputs leaving the system (the uptake of nutrients for crop and pasture production) [OECD] 	|  	| Fresh water 	| [View](https://data.oecd.org/agrland/nutrient-balance.htm){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Nutrient Leaching 	| Leachate, Leaching, Nitrate Leaching 	| The mass of dissolved nutrients (particularly nitrogen, in the form of nitrate) from a farming system nutrient balance, by draining through the soil and below the plant root zone. 	|  	| Fresh water 	| [View](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrate-leaching-from-livestock){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Nutrient loss 	|  	| A small portion of nutrients is lost annually through the hydrological cycle and biological export to the atmosphere (Barnes et al. 1998). Major pathways in which these nutrients are lost include: soil erosion, leaching and gaseous losses. 	| String 	| Fresh water 	| [View](https://webpages.uidaho.edu/learn/ecology/lessons/lesson07/7_5.htm){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Overland flow 	| Run-off 	| The mass of soil particles, organic matter, and nutrients (with particular focus in New Zealand farming systems on phosphorus) from a farming system, typically from critical source areas, caused by precipitation, excess irrigation, or return flow. 	|  	| Fresh water 	|  	|  	|
| Product Lifecycle Emissions 	|  	| The inventory of emissions and removals associated with the lifecycle of a specific product. Standards for accounting for product lifecycle emissions support product labeling, performance claims, consumer and business decision making based on comparison of two or more products, and other types of comparison based on GHG impacts. 	| String 	| Emissions 	| [View](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Product-Life-Cycle-Accounting-Reporting-Standard_041613.pdf){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Scope 1 Direct Emissions 	| Direct greenhouse gas emission 	| Direct GHG emissions occur from sources that  are owned or controlled by the company, for example,  emissions from combustion in owned or controlled  boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.; emissions from chemical  production in owned or controlled process equipment.    	| String 	| Emissions 	| [View](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Scope 2 Indirect Emissions 	| Energy emissions, electricity emissions 	| Emissions from the generation of acquired and consumed electricity, steam, head, or cooling. These emissions are termed "scope 2" and are considered an indirect emissions source, because the emissions are a consequence of activities of the reporting organisation but actually occur at sources owner or controlled by another organisation. 	| String 	| Emissions 	| [View](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Scope%202%20Guidance.pdf){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
| Scope 3 Value Chain Emissions 	| Scope 3 Emissions 	| All other indirect emissions (excepting scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) that occur in a company's value chain. Scope 3 emissions can represent the largest source of emissions for companies and present the most significant opportunities to influence GHG reductions and achieve a variety of GHG-related business objectives. 	|  	| Emissions 	| [View](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Corporate-Value-Chain-Accounting-Reporing-Standard_041613_2.pdf){:target="_blank"} 	|  	|
