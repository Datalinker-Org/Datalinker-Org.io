| Indirect Emissions | Indirect emissions from a building, home or business are those emissions of greenhouse gases that occur as a result of the generation of electricity used in that building. These emissions are called “indirect” because the actual emissions occur at the power plant which generates the electricity, not at the building using the electricity. | [View](https://www.greenbuildinglawupdate.com/2022/06/articles/ghg/glossary-of-greenhouse-gas-terms/){:target="_blank"} |
