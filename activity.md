<p>The Farm Data Standards and DataLinker were developed as separate initiatives to help agricultural data be more accessible for 
farmers and to be used more effectively by solution and service providers.</p>

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Farm Operation  | The activities carried out on a farm to prepare land, manage livestock, produce crops, or achieve environmental or social outcomes.  | - |
| Equipment calibration  | Equipment calibration deals with assessing the accuracy of equipment’s results by measuring the variation against a defined standard to decide upon the relevant correction factors.  | [View](https://learngxp.com/good-validation-practices/defining-calibration-qualification-of-equipment/){:target="_blank"} |
| Grazing management  | 1. Grazing management is the planning, implementation and monitoring of animal grazing to achieve sustained animal, plant, land, environmental and economic results under a range of environmental conditions. <br /> 2.Grazing management is the manipulation of animal grazing to achieve optimum and sustained animal, plant, land, environmental or economic results while ensuring a continuous supply of forages to grazing animals.| [View](http://www.nagrasslands.org/category/beneficial-management-practices/grazing-management/){:target="_blank"} [View](https://www.cost869.alterra.nl/SERA17_BMP/BMP_grazing_management.pdf){:target="_blank"} |

| Carbon Capture and Sequestration | Carbon capture and sequestration is a set of technologies that can greatly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing coal- and gas-fired power plants, industrial processes, and other stationary sources of carbon dioxide. | [View](https://www.greenbuildinglawupdate.com/2022/06/articles/ghg/glossary-of-greenhouse-gas-terms/){:target="_blank"} |
| Carbon neutrality | Carbon-neutral (or carbon neutrality) is the balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon emissions from carbon sinks. Or simply, eliminate all carbon emissions altogether. | [View](){:target="_blank"} |
| GHG Mitigation | Any action that results, by design, in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by sources or removals by sinks. Mitigation and abatement are considered equivalent terms | [View](https://environment.govt.nz/publications/discussion-paper-on-measures-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-new-zealand-post-2012/12-glossary/){:target="_blank"} |
